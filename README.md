## Picture Matching Game Project

The Picture Matching Game project is developed using Java and JavaFX, offering three levels of difficulty: easy, hard, and impossible. This interactive game is integrated with MySQL to store user information and player scores, which are then ranked in a table within the application.

### Key Features:

1. **Multiple Difficulty Levels:**
   - The game offers three levels of difficulty to cater to players of different skill levels: easy, hard, and impossible.
   - Each difficulty level presents varying challenges, such as the number of cards to match or the speed of card movements.

2. **MySQL Integration:**
   - The project connects to a MySQL database to store user information and player scores securely.
   - User profiles and scores are managed efficiently within the database for tracking and analysis.

3. **Score Ranking Table:**
   - Players' scores are recorded and displayed in a ranking table within the application.
   - Users can view their own scores as well as compare their performance with other players.

### How It Works:

- **JavaFX User Interface:** The application utilizes JavaFX for building an interactive and visually appealing user interface.
- **Game Logic:** The game logic includes functionalities for shuffling cards, tracking matches, and calculating scores based on player performance.
- **MySQL Database Management:** Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) is used to establish a connection between the application and the MySQL database.
- **Score Tracking and Ranking:** Player scores are updated and ranked in real-time, allowing users to track their progress and compete with others.

### Future Enhancements:

- **Enhanced User Experience:** Implement animations, sound effects, and user-friendly interfaces to enhance the gaming experience.
- **Customization Options:** Allow users to customize game settings, such as card themes, background music, and difficulty levels.
- **Additional Game Modes:** Expand the game with new modes, challenges, and gameplay mechanics to keep users engaged.
- **Performance Optimization:** Optimize database queries and application performance to ensure smooth gameplay and responsiveness.
